## Project Description
This project is part of the course FYS-STK3155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning. It focuses on implementing a neural network from scratch using NumPy, including forward and backward propagation, loss functions, activation functions, and optimizers. The network is tested on regression and classification tasks such as the Runge function and the MNIST dataset, and results are analyzed through accuracy and loss visualizations.

## Required Packages
